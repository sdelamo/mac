      "description": "I like to think of myself as a full-stack developer. \n\t\nSince 2017, I have been a core contributor to both open-source JVM frameworks Micronaut.io and Grails.org\n\t\nBefore that, I developed applications (both iOS and Android) and built websites for small to medium businesses. From WordPress to static websites to custom web applications. I have been self-employed since 2008. First, I was consulting, and then I had a startup for three years.   \n\t\nI like Gradle, Java, Groovy, HTML and CSS, and the web.\n\t\nI like to write. I used to write a newsletter (https://groovycalamari.com). Nowadays, I write in my blog (https://sergiodelamo.com). \n\t\nI like podcasts. Moreover, I am currently the host of two podcasts (https://micronautpodcast.com and http://codigobot.com) which I self-publish. \n\t\nI have done public speaking in conferences, user groups, and online events. I teach Micronaut and Grails training both on-site and online. \n\t\nMy Dreams\n\nI want to release a Software a Service application. Design it, code it, and control every decision around it. \n\n37 Signals and Apple have always been an inspiration to me. Working for Apple would be another dream. \n\nPersonal\n\nI live in Guadalajara, Spain. I have two kids. My family network is here, and I don't see myself moving or commuting to work anytime soon. I have been working remotely since 2017.\n\nI am all-in on the Apple Ecosystem. I purchase a lot of Apple products. I like to consume Apple news (sixcolors.com and daringfireball.net), and related podcasts (Upgrade or Mac Power users - https://www.relay.fm/upgrade or https://www.relay.fm/mpu) are among my favorite podcasts. \n\t\nI like chess and poker but have not played for the past several years.",

Also, I supported clients using Grails. Moreover, I worked directly in the open-source development of the Grails Framework. I contributed to the framework core code, plugins (especially security modules), and guides. I have written/reviewed almost every Grails guide. https://guides.grails.org\n\nI got involved with the Micronaut framework since its inception in 2018, and my work shifted from Grails to Micronaut.\n\nSince March 2022, I have been a member of the Micronaut Foundation Board Of Directors and Micronaut Development Lead at Object Computing. Currently, I manage the framework releases and schedule and help coordinate the collaboration of the Oracle Labs and Object Computing teams. \n\nMy most significant areas of contribution to the framework are: \nI write / review most of the Micronaut Guides (https://guides.micronaut.io)\nI review PRs (pull requests), release modules, and contribute code to the framework. \nI have done a lot of the development of the modules: Security, AWS, Views, RSS, Problem+JSON, Email, Microstream, Chatbots, and Multi-tenancy.\nI do talks at conferences, meetups, and online webinars about the Micronaut framework.\nI search for sponsors for the Micronaut foundation and help with partners. \n"
