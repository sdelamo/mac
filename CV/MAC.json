The job is flexible in terms of working hours. I can adjust my job around my kids schedule. \n\nHowever, an unfulfilled dream for me is to release a Software a Service application. Design it, code it, control every decision around it. Basecamp (37 Signals) have always been an inspiration to me.\n\nWorking for Apple would another dream\n\n",
