I like to consider myself a [manager of one](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one).\n\n\n**Open Source**\nI have contributed to open-source for the past six years and am a core committer to the Grails and Micronaut frameworks. \n\n**Java ecosystem**\nMost of my experience is in the Java ecosystems. I have experience with JVM languages such as Groovy, Kotlin, or Java, testing frameworks such as JUnit or Spock, build tools such as Gradle, and JVM frameworks such as Micronaut, Grails, and Spring Boot. \n\n**Public Speaking**\nI have talked at conferences and user groups in Spain and internationally. \n\n**Technical Writer**\nI have written extensive documentation and tutorials for both Grails and Micronaut frameworks.\n\n**Consultancy**\nBefore working on open-source, I co-founded a startup and had a small consultancy company building for clients Webs, web applications, and mobile applications - both in Android and IOS. I have experience dealing with clients and proposing solutions to their needs and budgets.\n\n",

I have barely no deadlines. I can do different things (which suites me) from writing code, to writing documentation, do podcasts, public speaking, training. The job is flexible in terms of working hours. I can adjust my job around my kids schedule. \n\nHowever, an unfulfilled dream for me is to release a Software a Service application. Design it, code it, control every decision around it. Basecamp (37 Signals) have always been an inspiration to me.\n\nWorking for Apple would another dream\n\n",
